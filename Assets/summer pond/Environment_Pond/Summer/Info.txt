Some info to get you started

1. Some steps you need to take in order to make everything work:
- in Project Settings / Player / Rendering dropdown, change the Color Space to Linear
- In Project Settings / Quality / Other, change the Lod Bias to 3. If you don't want to change this due to your other props LOD's, just change the LOD's distances of the prefabs

2. For Built-in:
- install the post processing stack v2 from the Window / Package manager
- unpack the "Built-in_materials" if you are upgrading from URP
- unpack the "Built-in_demoScenes" for the demo scenes with post processing

3. For URP:
- unpack the "URP_assets" if you are upgrading from Built-in
	- the Buit-in vegetation models and materials will not be replaced; only the vegetation PREFABS
- unpack the "URP_demoScenes" for the demo scenes with Volumes

NOTE: in order to work in URP, the procedural trees and bushes created in Built-in were transfomed into .fbx files. 
You don't need to do anything!
I'm providing this information in case you want to create more trees procedurally and then make them work in URP.
	- install the free asset pack: Autodesk FBX SDK for Unity
	- this pack is able to transform the existing procedural vegetation objects created in the Buit-in pipeline, into .fbx duplicates 
	- for the leaves there is a URP shader provided (created with AI); the bark is using a standard URP lit shader


4. Possible issue: if you add the packs to the project before having the processing stack v2 installed, it's possible that the scenes might give some errors. 
Just install the processing stack v2 and re-open the scenes or remove and post processing components and volumes from the scenes and re-open them.
